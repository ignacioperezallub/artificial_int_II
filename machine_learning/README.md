# Assignment noÂ° 2 : Machine Learning Fundamentals
## Mandatory Exercises:

1. Familiarize with the code of the fully connected feedforward neural network with 1 hidden layer explained in class.
2. Modify the program to:
* Measure classification accuracy in addition to loss value.
* Use an independent test set for this measurement (instead of using the same training data).
3.Implement early stopping using a validation set different from the training and test sets.
4.Experiment with different data generator configuration parameters to generate more complex datasets.
5. Modify the program to work for regression problems:
* Modify the loss function and its derivatives.
* Create a new data generator to generate continuous data.
6. Perform a parameter sweep (learning rate, number of neurons in the hidden layer, comparison of ReLU with Sigmoid).

## Optional Exercises:

7. Re-implement the entire fully connected feedforward network.
8. Develop analytically and implement an additional hidden layer.
9. Test the neural network with datasets taken from one of the following sources:
Machine Learning Repository of the University of California in Irvine.
Kaggle.
10. Implement advanced features in the neural network (regularization, other weight optimization algorithms such as Momentum or Adam, Dropout, etc.).
11. Familiarize with the use of the Keras library with Tensorflow and implement a fully connected feedforward network similar to the one seen with this library.
